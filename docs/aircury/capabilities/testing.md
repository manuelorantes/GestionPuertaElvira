Testing standards plus curated Playwright and E2E testing skills

## Framework Rules

## Testing Strategy

Automated tests are required for behaviour that matters. The test suite should be fast at the bottom, realistic at the boundaries, and selective with full end-to-end coverage.

### TDD Workflow

Testing includes a red -> green -> refactor workflow by default.

Work in vertical slices:

1. Write one failing test for one observable behaviour.
2. Implement the minimum code needed to pass.
3. Refactor while keeping tests green.
4. Repeat.

Do not batch all tests first. Do not batch all implementation first.

### Coverage Model

- Write unit tests for domain logic, pure functions, transformations, policies, and other isolated behaviour with meaningful branching.
- Write integration tests for application use cases, persistence adapters, HTTP handlers, messaging flows, and other boundary-crossing behaviour.
- Write end-to-end tests only for critical user journeys, production wiring, and regressions that cannot be trusted at lower levels alone.
- Prefer a balanced test pyramid over a top-heavy suite of slow UI tests.

Ratio guide for a healthy suite:

- Unit: roughly 70%
- Integration: roughly 20%
- E2E: roughly 10%

Treat these as steering ratios, not coverage gates.

### Frontend Defaults

When the project has a frontend, prefer this default toolchain unless the repository already standardises on something else:

- **Vitest** for unit and component-level execution.
- **Testing Library** for behaviour-driven UI tests through accessible queries.
- **Playwright** for browser-level end-to-end coverage.

Frontend testing rules:

- Test user-observable behaviour, not component internals.
- Prefer Testing Library queries by role, label, and visible text before falling back to test IDs.
- Keep Playwright focused on high-value journeys such as authentication, checkout, onboarding, critical CRUD flows, or cross-page regressions.
- Avoid large snapshot suites with low signal.

### Backend Defaults

Backend services must always include:

- **Unit tests** for domain behaviour and isolated business rules.
- **Integration tests** for adapters, data access, transport layers, and boundary contracts.

Language and framework-specific tools may vary by repository, but these expectations do not.

### Test Quality Rules

- Structure tests with a clear Given-When-Then or Arrange-Act-Assert flow.
- Name tests by observable outcome, ideally in a `should ... when ...` style.
- Prefer real collaborators inside the boundary under test and mock only true external systems or uncontrollable side effects.
- Keep each test isolated and independent. No test may depend on another test's execution order or data.
- Keep fixtures small and intention-revealing.
- Prefer deterministic tests with controlled inputs, clocks, randomness, and network boundaries.
- Avoid sleep-based timing assertions and other timeout-driven checks unless time is the behaviour under test.
- Make regressions reproducible with a focused failing test before fixing the bug.
- Keep the fast-feedback layer fast enough to run on every commit locally and in CI.
- Ensure tests can run reliably in CI without hidden local prerequisites.
- Do not ship features that only have manual verification when automated coverage is feasible.

## Agent Operating Rules

- Testing strategy is enabled. Choose the smallest test layer that can prove the behaviour with confidence.
- Write the failing test first when automated coverage is feasible.
- Prefer a test pyramid with many unit tests, fewer integration tests, and only a small number of critical E2E tests.
- Frontend code should default to Vitest for unit or component tests, Testing Library for user-facing UI behaviour, and Playwright for critical end-to-end journeys unless the repo already enforces another stack.
- Backend code MUST include unit tests and integration tests, even when the exact framework varies by language.
- Structure tests clearly with Given-When-Then or Arrange-Act-Assert.
- Prefer behaviour-focused assertions through public interfaces and accessible UI queries over internal implementation checks.
- Keep tests isolated, deterministic, and fast enough for regular local execution and CI.
- Add or update regression coverage for every confirmed bug when automated testing is feasible.
